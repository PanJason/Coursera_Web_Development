                    <p>A healthy and tasty chicken salad with a fruity twist - great
                         on a croissant or in a honey pita. Note: This salad is best
                          if eaten the day after preparation. This allows the
                           ingredients time to mingle, giving a fuller flavor.
                            If desired, use nonfat mayonnaise.</p>

                        Just like my Korean mom makes it! It's delicious! Even better
                         if rolled up in red leaf lettuce with rice and hot pepper paste.
                          If you want to spice it up just add red pepper powder to your
                           marinade.

                <p>
                    Nigirizushi (握り寿司, "hand-pressed sushi") consists of an
                     oblong mound of sushi rice that the chef presses between
                      the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a
                       topping (the neta) draped over the ball. It is usually
                        served with a bit of wasabi; neta are typically fish such as
                         salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are
                          typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, 
                          most commonly octopus (tako), freshwater eel (unagi), sea
                           eel (anago), squid (ika), and sweet egg (tamago). One
                            order of a given type of fish typically results in two
                             pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain 
                             only one piece of each topping.
